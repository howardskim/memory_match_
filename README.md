# Memory Match

## Overview

> Memory match is a game with 18 cards face down and the player has to try and match all 9 pairs of matching cards by remembering the position of the cards.
Once the player has match 2 cards they will be displayed face up until all pairs have been matched. Once all pairs have been matched the user will be
displayed a message that they have won the game. As the user clicks through the cards stats will be kept letting the user know how many attempts and the
accuracy of their choices.

## Technologies Used
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Object-Oriented Programming

## Personal
> - I used flex-box and media queries for responsiveness. At first, the project was created with just procedural programming and was later converted into the Object Oriented Paradigm after we learned about it.
> - I developed the game logic to randomize the cards, add a corresponding sound for each match, and appended an appropriate image for each matching pair to the DOM.
> - This was the first official game I had created after learning about the advantages of CSS properties such as flexbox and grid systems. It made designing and creating projects more interesting and fun to do as it saved a lot of time.
> - I learned about OOP and how everything is essential an object and can be converted into the paradigm. I got a better understanding of classes, constructors, binding "this" and handling events in a new way.
